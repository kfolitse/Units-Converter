# Units-Converter

The problem I solved is from the following link.

You should have cppunit library installed in your computer before running test.cpp file.

cppunit can be downloaded  from  https://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit/

To run the whole program, including the test file test.cpp, type "make". 

All files must be in the same directory as the Makefile.

To ignore the test file and run units.cpp only, just type "make converter".
